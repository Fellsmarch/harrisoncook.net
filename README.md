# harrisoncook.net
My personal website, built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework with the [hello-friend-ng theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/).

## Developing
Run `hugo server` to start a local server on `localhost:1313` with hot reloading. Use the `-D` flag to include content marked as draft.

Create new files using `hugo new <CATEGORY>/<FILENAME>`. For example: `hugo new posts/my-test-post.md`

## Deploying
To build run `hugo`.
